# In this notebook,Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# **Objectives:**
# - List popular languages for Data Science
# - List commonly used libraries for Data Science
# - List open source Data Science Tools
# - Demonstrate some arithmetic operators

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. R
# 2. Python
# 3. SQL

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. Pandas
# 2. Numbpy
# 3. ggplot2

# |Data Science Tools|
# |---|
# |Apache Spark|
# |Apache Hadoop|
# |PyTorch|

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[4]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers. The result should be 17
(3*4)+5


# In[5]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
200/60
